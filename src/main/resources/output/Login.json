After logging in successfully, one session ID will be returned in HTTP response body.\n\t\tAt the same time, two HTTP cookie items named \"B1SESSION\" and \"ROUTEID\" will be set. You do not need to relate to them if calling the Service Layer API in a browser because the browser will send them to Service Layer automatically in subsequent HTTP requests. \n\t\tYou do need to add them to your HTTP header in a subsequent Service Layer API call. Otherwise, Service Layer will consider them as a bad request without a login.\n\t\t"}]}
